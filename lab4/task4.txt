Application: Recipe extraction for cake-baking platforms

Description:
This application processes written cake recipes and converts them into a structured format that
can be used by recipe websites, kitchen assistants, or automated kitchen equipment. The system
extracts ingredients with quantities, cooking actions, tools, temperatures, and timing from free‑
text instructions. The output is a clear step-by-step workflow, a shopping list, and automated
timers for each cooking step.

Why syntactic and dependency parsing are needed:
- Constituency parsing (phrase structure) identifies meaningful chunks such as ingredient
  phrases (e.g., "two large eggs", "250 g flour") and action phrases (e.g., "beat until fluffy").
- Dependency parsing reveals grammatical relations between words: which verb applies to which
  ingredient or tool (for example, "fold in the flour" links the action "fold" to the object
  "flour"). Dependency relations also clarify modifiers like duration and temperature
  (e.g., "bake at 180°C for 30 minutes").
- Parsing helps detect negation or conditions (e.g., "do not overmix" or "until golden brown"),
  which are important for correct execution.

How it is used (simple steps):
1. Run a syntactic and dependency parser on each recipe sentence.
2. Extract ingredient phrases and normalize quantities and units.
3. Use dependency relations to link actions with their direct objects, modifiers, and timings.
4. Build a structured recipe and generate a shopping list, scaled quantities, and timed steps.

Benefits:
By converting unstructured recipes into structured data, the system enables automated scaling,
voice-guided cooking, accurate timers, and better search and recommendation features for a cake‑
baking platform.
